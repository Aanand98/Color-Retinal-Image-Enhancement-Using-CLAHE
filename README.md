# Operating System


This project was implemented on an Online Environment - Google Colaboratory.
It can be implemented on Mac OS 12.6, Windows 11.


# Steps for execution
1. Pip install all the required libraries, as mentioned in requirements.txt.
2. Ensure the images are in the same folder as the code. (If using Colab or Kaggle or any online notebook, upload the images onto the notebook.)
3. Run the python code and view the results.


# Problem Description

Our project aims to make use of Histogram Equalization. We use the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm to enhance these images. CLAHE can enhance the imageâ€™s quality in channels, namely, G(Green), R(Red) and B(Blue). For example, A retinal Image is enhanced using the G channel in CLAHE. In this report, we demonstrate an enhancement method using CLAHE with different images being enhanced in appropriate channels to enhance image quality.
